# Operating System Abstraction Layer (OSAL)

Each source-file in this directory implements the operating system abstraction layer for MicroTBX-Modbus for a specific operating system. 

**Important**: 

* Only add one of these source-files to your project, namely the one for the operating system that your project is based on. If you add more then one of these source-file, you will get build errors.
